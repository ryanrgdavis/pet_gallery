## :unamused: Lessons Learnt

Through developing this app, I've learned the importance of planning first and not focusing on complex ideas and focusing on user experience instead. In the future, I will strive to follow the "Keep It Simple Stupid" principle. I didn't completely understand that last time, but hopefully this time I did.

## :white_check_mark: Future Features

- Displaying the current user's username in the comment section
- Implementing user authentication and authorization
- Adding a search functionality to find specific pet profiles
- Enhancing the user interface with more interactive elements and animations
